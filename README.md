**DISCLAIMER**:
This project is not intended for everyday use and made available without any support.
However, we welcome any kind of feedback via the issue tracker or if appropriate via IREE's [communication channels](https://github.com/iree-org/iree#communication-channels), e.g. via the Discord server.

This projects demonstrates how to build [IREE](https://github.com/iree-org/iree) with the [Arm GNU Toolchain](https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/developer-tools/gnu-toolchain) for bare-metal Arm targets using either the open-source firmware library [libopencm3](https://github.com/libopencm3/libopencm3) or [CMSIS](https://github.com/ARM-software/CMSIS_5).

The project was originally initiated at Fraunhofer IML.

## Target Support

The samples can be build for several [STM32 32-bit Arm Cortex MCUs](https://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers-microprocessors/stm32-32-bit-arm-cortex-mcus.html),
for the [Nordic nRF52840 SoC](https://www.nordicsemi.com/products/nrf52840),
for the application core of the [Nordic nRF5340 SoC](https://www.nordicsemi.com/products/nrf5340)
and for the Arm [Corstone-300](https://developer.arm.com/Processors/Corstone-300).

## Getting Started
